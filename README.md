Project Description:

The application for Dr. Pepper's pediatric clinic is a robust interface that allows for the interaction between patients and doctors at the given clinic. The code is developed in java to create the framework for the javafx GUI to function. Also includes portions of javascript to add additional functionalities. Specific functionality for the application goes as follows:

- Doctors for the clinic can be connected to a given group of patients that they can perscribe medication to.
- Patients can register at the clinic to have an account generated.
- Patients can sign in to a Patient portal with several different functions (Message Doctor, Update Information, Check current perscription).
- Doctors have a separate portal in which they can respond to patient messages, write in perscriptions for patients to a given pharmacy on record, and manage patient records.
- Functionality for Nurses, being a limited version of Doctors is also included.
- Nurses can input/update patient data.
- Includes a staff sign in portal in which Doctors and Nurses can sign in to their respective sides of the application.
- Includes database support for storing information and records of Patients, Nurses, and Doctors
